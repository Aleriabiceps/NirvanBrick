                            Nowadays, almost every group has info for items dropping. But we‚Äôre not every group.
                            <u>We take it one step further, with our stock numbers, early links, scripts, and bypasses.</u>
                            On top of that, we cook items exclusive to only our group.

                            Nirvan‚Äôs Brickseek does not rely on humans for a majority of our flips.
                            70% of our price errors and instore flips come from <u>machine learning algorithms</u> scouring the internet,
                            <u>making sure we leave no rock unturned.</u> This reflects in our posts, as we find every sellable item,
                            days or weeks before every other group. Why rely on a process that includes human errors?

                            A lot of groups sell as many memberships as possible. We intentionally keep membership stock as low as possible.
                            We make sure that our staff and infrastructure can <u>put the current members first.</u> We hold 1 on 1 sessions to ensure every member is able to cook,
                            and hold voice sessions to facilitate learning and discussion. All of our members will attest to the fact that any time they‚Äôve had a problem,
                            we‚Äôve made a substantial effort to solve it.

                            It‚Äôs easy for a group to pay their way to the top providers. On top of the info and items, through our connections,
                            <u>we make getting and reselling items as easy as possible.</u> We have groupbuys for some of the best tools in the game,

                            An issue we‚Äôve heard from a lot of our members about other groups is the lack of a community.
                            We‚Äôve sought out to fix that from day 1, via our active chat, Q&A sessions, and family feel.
                            From the outside, that‚Äôs really hard to understand, so we‚Äôve decided to <u>link a couple of our members' testimonials below,
                            and let them show what we have to offer themselves.</u>
